## ðŸ“– Project Overview  
The project NSEI Stock Market Analysis (2015â€“2023) focuses on understanding the long-term trends, volatility, and performance of the Indian stock market using historical data from the National Stock Exchange Index. The dataset contains daily records of open, high, low, close prices, and trading volumes from 2015 to 2023. The first step in the project involved cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, ensuring the dates were properly formatted and values sorted chronologically. Feature engineering was then applied to calculate important indicators such as daily returns, cumulative returns, moving averages (20-day, 50-day, and 200-day), and volatility measures. These features provided deeper insights into short-term fluctuations and long-term trends of the index.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed several important patterns. For example, the analysis of top gain and loss days highlighted extreme volatility during global and national crises, especially in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Yearly and monthly trend analysis showed that years like 2017 and 2021 performed exceptionally well, while bearish phases were observed in 2015 and 2020. Visualization techniques such as candlestick charts, line graphs, moving average overlays, and bar plots of volatility provided a clearer picture of market dynamics. Moreover, the correlation between trading volume and returns indicated that spikes in activity often preceded large price movements.

The findings suggest that while NSEI demonstrates strong long-term growth, short-term volatility poses risks for traders. Long-term investors benefit from trend-following strategies, while short-term traders should incorporate volatility-adjusted stop-loss methods. Overall, the project highlights how data-driven analysis can guide investment strategies, improve risk management, and offer valuable insights into the Indian stock marketâ€™s behavior.
